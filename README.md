# SAHAYAK_BOT
 In the early days, robots meant using actuators to enact human body movements. Today, robots are used to assist humans or to reduce human efforts rather than just mimicking humans. With massive development of AI and machine learning, robots are now capable of taking their own decisions. In-fact this introduction's sentence structure, grammar and spelling were checked and improved with the help of a ‘robot’. Astonishing, isn’t it? Robots are leaving the comforts of a controlled factory environment and moving to the unpredictable environment we inhabit. This ‘real-world environment’ holds many interesting and complex challenges for us engineers to explore and resolve.

Assistance robots are being massively used around the globe be it in the medical industry or the food business. Although significant progress has been made there is so much more to explore in a variety of fields. Assistance robots are presently seen in applications such as cleaning, gardening and entertainment. What if we could build a robot that can truly assist in your tasks just like a human-partner would. The applications for such a robot are limitless and are constrained only by the limits of our imagination. 
In this project we will learn 2D mapping, 3D mapping, Autonomous Navigation, Perception, Pick and Place.
